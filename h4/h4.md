# H4 Hash

## x) Read and summarize [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003).

## 2.3 One-Way Functions

* **A one-way function is important in public-key cryptography. One-way functions are not protocols themselves, but they are an essential component of the majority of protocols.** One-way functions are simple to calculate but difficult to invert. If you are given x, it is simple to calculate f(x), but is difficult to determine x when given f(x). It might take millions of years to solve even if every computer in the world worked on it at the same time. A typical example of a one-way function is breaking a plate into little pieces, which is simple to do but complex to reconstruct.

**The picture below shows a good example of a one-way function.**

* **The existence of one-way functions has not been confirmed mathematically, and there is no evidence that they can exist.** However, many functions appear to be have one-way functions in their fundamental concept because they can be efficiently calculated and not being reversed. A simple example of such a function is x2, but x1/2 is far more complicated to calculate. If messages encrypted using a one-way function, they cannot be decrypted, and thats why one-way function is not used used for encryption.

* **A trapdoor one-way function is a special type of one-way function with secret trap-door.** With the trapdoor one-way function, it is easy to compute in one direction but difficult in the other, but if you know the secret, it becomes easy to compute in both directions. A watch disassembly is an example of a trapdoor one-way function since it is difficult to rebuild without the instructions but much easier with them.

**The picture below has a simple visualisation of a trapdoor one-way function.**

## 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

* One-way hash functions are a fundamental part of cryptography and used in many protocols.
* A hash function is a mathematical or other type of function that takes a variable-length input string (pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length (hash value)
* The hash function operates in one direction, making it easy to convert pre-image to hash value but hard to reverse the process.
* A good hash function should not have collisions, meaning it's hard for two different pre-images to have the same hash value.
* The security of the hash function lies in its one-wayness and the fact that a small change in the pre-image results in a significant change in the hash value.
* Changing just one bit of the pre-image can change half of the bits in the hash value
* It's difficult to determine the original pre-image from the hash value.
* Hash functions can be used to verify if someone has a particular file without sending the file itself, useful in financial transactions
* Hash functions are usually used without a key, allowing anyone to verify, but a key can be used to enhance security.

## a) Install Hashcat.

I followed the instruction on webpage [Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/) and used the command `sudo apt-get update`to to download package information from all configured sources and after I used the command `sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget`to imstall Hashcat.

I had previously installed hashcat, so in my case, it simply displayed the 0 upgrade.

Next, I created a directory for my work using the commands `mkdir hashed` and `cd hashed`to create and enter the directory.

Next, I downloaded the most popular dictionary Rockyou with the commands <br>
`wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz` <br>
`tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz`and <br>
`rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz`

So, now we are ready to crack the hash.

## b) Crack this hash: `8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f`

To decrypt the hash `8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f`, I first identified the hash using the command `hashid -m 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f`.

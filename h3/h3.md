## x) Read and summarize [Costa-Gazc√≥n 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-threat-intelligence/9781838556372/B13376_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-75)

Understanding the opponent:

* Knowing your opponent's motivations, strategies, and techniques is critical.
* Understanding the architecture, tactics, and tools of the opposition
* How to assess the sophistication and capacity of the adversary
* Adversary intelligence gathering:
* Enemy intelligence sources, including open-source, commercial, and internal sources
* The significance of obtaining knowledge from multiple sources
* Threat intelligence platforms' roles in gathering and managing enemy intelligence
<br>
* Analyzing adversarial behavior:
The significance of recognizing trends in enemy conduct
How to apply adversary behavior analysis to comprehend their strategies, tactics, approaches, and procedures (TTPs)
Machine learning's role in automating adversary behavior analysis
Analysis of adversary infrastructure:
<br>
Understanding the adversary's infrastructure, including command and control servers and other resources, is critical.
How to locate and map your adversary's infrastructure
The significance of network analysis in comprehending the adversary's architecture
Adversary identification:
<br>
The difficulties in attribution of cyber attacks to specific enemies
The significance of employing a variety of procedures and sources to validate attribution
The use of digital forensics and malware analysis in attributing individual adversaries to attacks
The life cycle of the adversary:

* Understanding the many stages of an adversary's life cycle, such as target selection, intrusion, and post-infiltration activities
It is critical to map the adversary's life cycle in order to detect potential vulnerabilities and inform response and mitigation techniques.

* My Thought: In threat intelligence and data-driven threat hunting, mapping the opponent is critical. It assists organizations in understanding their attackers' goals, methods, and techniques, as well as their infrastructure, behavior, and attribution. Understanding the adversary's life cycle can help inform response and mitigation methods, making the organization more resilient to cyber threats.

## Write an answer with references. Answer in the context of [Mitre Att&ck](https://attack.mitre.org/), and pick examples that are different from the chapter in task x

* Mitre Att&ck is a knowledge repository of adversary tactics and techniques used in cyber attacks that is available globally. The framework provides a common language and knowledge of adversary tactics, methods, and procedures (TTPs), which businesses can utilize to improve their threat intelligence and security posture.
<br>
* A tactic is a high-level category of behaviors utilized by an enemy during an attack in Mitre Att&ck. A tactic explains the overarching purpose of the attack and describes what the enemy wants to accomplish. The approach "Initial Access," for example, outlines how an adversary gains a foothold in a target's network.
<br>
* In Mitre Att&ck, a technique is a specialized strategy utilized by an enemy to attain a tactical aim. A technique is a more specific description of an adversary's actions. The technique "Exploit Public-Facing Application," for example, describes using a vulnerability in a web application to get initial access to a target's network.
<br>
* Subtechnique: In Mitre Att&ck, a subtechnique is a sub-component of a technique that provides even more detail on the exact actions made by an adversary. For example, the subtechnique "SQL Injection" outlines a specific approach of employing SQL injection to exploit a vulnerability in a web application.
<br>
* In Mitre Att&ck, a method is a step-by-step explanation of an adversary's actions during an assault. Procedures explain an adversary's specific activities taken to acquire a technique or subtechnique. For example, the operation "Gain Valid Credentials" details the steps an adversary takes to obtain valid credentials for a target's network, which might be a strategy used to achieve the tactical aim of "Initial Access".

* My opinion: Mitre Att&ck gives an organized and thorough understanding of adversaries' TTPs in cyber attacks. By offering a consistent vocabulary and understanding of adversary tactics, strategies, and procedures, the framework assists businesses in improving their threat intelligence and security posture.

## Webgoat: A3 Sensitive data exposure Insecure Login: 2 Let's try
In Webgoat, I successfully completed the "Insecure Login: 2 Let's Try" lesson. This lesson educated me about the dangers of exposing sensitive data during the login process and how to avoid them.

Using the instructions in the assignment, I decided to utilize a sniffing tool (Packet Sniffing is the process of expanding monitors checks every packet that passes through any network). I looked up which tool is to monitor pakets which are passed thouw network and in the result decided to instal Wireshark because is one of the most popular one and I found intruction [how to install Wireshark](https://linuxhint.com/install-wireshark-debian-11/).
To install wireshark I used the command `su` to get acces as sudoer and after I used the command `sudo apt install wireshark -y`

After installation I opened wireshark and chose 'loopback: lo' and pressed on shark fin

Then I tried to log in with my credential.

## x) Read and summarize Costa-Gazc√≥n 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary

Understanding the opponent:

* Knowing your opponent's motivations, strategies, and techniques is critical.
* Understanding the architecture, tactics, and tools of the opposition
* How to assess the sophistication and capacity of the adversary
* Adversary intelligence gathering:
* Enemy intelligence sources, including open-source, commercial, and internal sources
* The significance of obtaining knowledge from multiple sources
* Threat intelligence platforms' roles in gathering and managing enemy intelligence
<br>
Analyzing adversarial behavior:
The significance of recognizing trends in enemy conduct
How to apply adversary behavior analysis to comprehend their strategies, tactics, approaches, and procedures (TTPs)
Machine learning's role in automating adversary behavior analysis
Analysis of adversary infrastructure:
<br>
Understanding the adversary's infrastructure, including command and control servers and other resources, is critical.
How to locate and map your adversary's infrastructure
The significance of network analysis in comprehending the adversary's architecture
Adversary identification:
<br>
The difficulties in attribution of cyber attacks to specific enemies
The significance of employing a variety of procedures and sources to validate attribution
The use of digital forensics and malware analysis in attributing individual adversaries to attacks
The life cycle of the adversary:

* Understanding the many stages of an adversary's life cycle, such as target selection, intrusion, and post-infiltration activities
It is critical to map the adversary's life cycle in order to detect potential vulnerabilities and inform response and mitigation techniques.

* My Thought: In threat intelligence and data-driven threat hunting, mapping the opponent is critical. It assists organizations in understanding their attackers' goals, methods, and techniques, as well as their infrastructure, behavior, and attribution. Understanding the adversary's life cycle can help inform response and mitigation methods, making the organization more resilient to cyber threats.

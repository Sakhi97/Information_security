## x) Read and summarize Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 (from start until the start of "Dereferencing Keys" in 10.4)

Section 10.1: Introduction to Algorithms

Cryptographic algorithms are mathematical operations used to transform plaintext into ciphertext
Examples of algorithms include symmetric-key algorithms, asymmetric-key algorithms, and hash functions
The security of an algorithm depends on the key size and the algorithm's strength against attacks

Section 10.2: Symmetric-Key Algorithms

Symmetric-key algorithms use the same key for encryption and decryption
Examples include the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and Blowfish
The strength of a symmetric-key algorithm is dependent on the key size and the number of rounds used in the algorithm

Section 10.3: Asymmetric-Key Algorithms

Asymmetric-key algorithms use a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption
Examples include the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms
Asymmetric-key algorithms are slower than symmetric-key algorithms but are useful for key exchange and digital signatures

Section 10.4: Hash Functions

Hash functions are used to generate a fixed-length output from an input of arbitrary length
Examples include the SHA-1 and SHA-2 algorithms
Hash functions are used for message authentication, digital signatures, and password storage

## y) Choose a password manager. 
* Explain: 
* What treaths does it protect against?
* What information is encrypted, what's not?
* What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
* Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
* How is the data protected?

* Pass is a free and open-source password manager that uses GPG encryption to secure the user's data. Here are the answers to your questions about Pass:

* Threats: Pass protects against various threats, such as password reuse, brute force attacks, and phishing, by allowing users to generate unique and complex passwords for each account and store them securely in an encrypted format.

* Encrypted information: Pass encrypts the user's passwords, usernames, and other information using GPG encryption. However, some metadata, such as the name of the website or service associated with each password, may not be encrypted.

* License: Pass is released under the GPLv2 license, which is a free and open-source software license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely. This license ensures that Pass will always remain free and open-source and that any modifications made to the software must be released under the same license.

* Data storage: Pass stores the user's data locally on their device, in a plain text format. This means that the user's data is not stored in the cloud or on a remote server. However, users can choose to sync their password store using a cloud storage service of their choice, such as Dropbox or Google Drive.

* Data protection: Pass uses GPG encryption to secure the user's data both at rest and in transit. Additionally, Pass relies on the user's GPG keypair to provide authentication and access control, which ensures that only the user who owns the GPG keypair can access their password store. It is important to note that because Pass stores data locally on the user's device, it is up to the user to ensure that their device is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

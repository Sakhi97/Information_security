## x) Read and summarize Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 (from start until the start of "Dereferencing Keys" in 10.4)

### Section 10 Using Algorithms

Cryptography is a security method that uses math to keep a system safe. Cryptography is the study of secure methods of sending communications that only the sender and the intended recipient can read. The old idea of computer cryptography as "spy against spy" technology is becoming less and less accurate. Almost all of the cryptography used in the world is not meant to protect military secrets. Instead, it is used to make it harder for people to commit small crimes. Most of the apps had bad encryption, but the attacks that worked had nothing to do with cryptanalysis. Most security problems in this area are caused by mistakes in how things are done, not by mistakes in algorithms or protocols. In these cases, it didn't matter how good the encryption was; the attacks that worked completely sidestepped it.


### Section 10.1: CHOOSING AN ALGORITHM
People have a few options when it comes to evaluating and choosing algorithms:

* They can choose a published method since numerous cryptographers have examined it and no one has broken it.
* People trust manufacturers because a well-known company has a reputation to keep and is unlikely to sell equipment or applications with worse algorithms.
* A private consultant can evaluate algorithms impartially, so they can trust them.
* People trust the government because they think it won't mislead them.
* They build their own algorithms because they believe they are the best at cryptography and should trust no one but themselves.

The first option seems greatest, but all have drawbacks. Trusting one corporation, consultancy, or government is risky. Most security consultants don't understand encryption, even if they work for big companies. Most security product makers aren't better. The NSA employs world-class cryptographers who don't reveal all. Their goals differ from those of their population. Even a genius shouldn't build their own algorithm and utilize it without checking it.

The general public doesn't know what military cryptanalysis organizations can do, and it's hard to figure out what algorithms the NSA can break. If the NSA knows how to break an algorithm, they usually don't tell anyone. People think that the NSA can read any message it wants, but it has to choose which ones to read first because it has limited resources. Most people should choose public algorithms that have stood up to scrutiny from the public.

#### Algorithms for Export

US export algorithms require government approval. These export-approved algorithms are believed to be NSA-breakable. The NSA is known to discreetly advise cryptography product exporters on several matters:

* Leak ciphertext key bits occasionally.
* Reduce the effective key to 30-bits. The method may accept 100-bit keys, but most are equal.
* Encrypt each encrypted message with a predetermined IV or header. This aids known-plaintext attacks.
* Encrypt a few random bytes with the key and put the plaintext and ciphertext at the beginning of the encrypted message. This aids known-plaintext attacks.

NSA receives the source code, but the algorithm remains secret. Beware if you buy an export-approved U.S. encryption product.

### Section 10.2: PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY VERSUS SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY

The question is whether public-key cryptography or symmetric cryptography is superior. The question is incorrect since we cannot compare these two approaches because each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In some scenarios, one strategy is more useful than another. While symmetric encryption is more cost-effective in terms of message amount and duration, public-key cryptography offers significant security benefits. For key management and a wide range of protocols, public-key cryptography is suitable, whereas symmetric cryptography is ideal for data encryption. Both encryption approaches have advantages and downsides, and they deal with various types of problems.

### Section 10.3: ENCRYPTING COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS

The author says that encryption can happen at any layer in the OSI communications model, but that it usually happens at layers one and two or higher. When encryption happens at the lowest layers, it is called link-by-link encryption, and when it happens at the highest layers, it is called end-to-end encryption. The first one encrypts everything that goes through a certain data link, while the second one encrypts only some of the data and keeps it encrypted until the intended recipient decrypts it. The author talks about the pros and cons of each method.

#### Link-by-Link Encryption

Link Encryption is a method in which a message sent over a network is encrypted and then decrypted at each node. It is used to stop traffic analysis and keep people from making mistakes. The security doesn't depend on any kind of traffic management, and it's easy to keep track of the keys. But the biggest problem with encryption at the physical layer is that every physical link in the network needs to be encrypted and every node in the network needs to be protected because it processes unencrypted data.

##### Advantages:

* Easier operation, since it can be made transparent to the user. That is, everything is encrypted before being sent over the link.
* Only one set of keys per link is required.
* Provides traffic-flow security, since any routing information is encrypted.
* Encryption is online.

##### Disadvantages:

* Data is exposed in the intermediate nodes.

#### End-to-End Encryption

End-to-end encryption is a safe way to send information from one endpoint to another that keeps third parties from getting access to the information.
End-to-end encryption uses an asymmetric approach. It will only encrypt the transport data units. This method doesn't encrypt routing information, and it can be harder to keep track of keys. High-level encryption in a communication architecture can work with any type of communication network, but different types of computers may not be able to work together. The major disadvantage of end-to-end encryption is that it allows traffic analysis.

##### Advantages:

* Higher secrecy level.

##### Disadvantages:

* Requires a more complex key-management system.
* Traffic analysis is possible, since routing information is not encrypted.
* Encryption is offline.

##### Combining the two

Combining the two is the most expensive but safest technique to secure a network. Because each physical link is encrypted, routing information can't be studied, and end-to-end encryption reduces the likelihood that network nodes won't encrypt data. Both schemes have separate key management. Network managers handle physical encryption, but users handle end-to-end encryption.


### Section 10.4: ENCRYPTING DATA FOR STORAGE

Encrypting data for storage is different from encrypting messages in transit because:

* If encrypted data can't be decrypted, it's lost forever; whereas, in transit, a message can be resent.
* The encryption key is smaller and needs to be managed and stored securely for a long time.
* There are more opportunities for a cryptanalyst to perform a known-plaintext attack, and ciphertext can be considerably larger than plaintext.
* Key management is more complicated, as different people may need access to different files or portions of the same file.
* The speed of I/O devices demands fast encryption and decryption, and will probably require encryption hardware. In some applications, special high-speed algorithms may be required.
* Safe, long-term storage for keys is required

## y) Choose a password manager. 
* Explain: Password managers are classified into two types: cloud and local. Cloud password managers are simple to use since they save your passwords in the cloud, which you can access from any device. They do, however, carry some risks. Hackers frequently target cloud servers to steal sensitive data, and your passwords could be revealed if your cloud password manager is compromised. This is especially dangerous if you use the same password for many accounts, because a hacker could acquire access to them all.

A local password manager, on the other hand, keeps your passwords on your own device, such as your computer or smartphone. This means you have complete control over your password database and can secure it. Your passwords should be safe as long as you keep your device secure and shielded from unauthorized access.

KeePassXC is a popular password manager with several characteristics that make it a good choice for secure and convenient password management. Why use KeePassXC as a password manager:

Security: KeePassXC protects password databases with industry-standard encryption techniques. Without the master password, hackers cannot see your database file.

KeePassXC supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can sync passwords across many devices.
Customization: KeePassXC lets you personalize its user interface, password creation choices, and auto-lock settings.
Browser integration: KeePassXC includes browser plugins for Chrome and Firefox that autofill website passwords and login details.
Security professionals can audit KeePassXC's open-source code. This can ensure the software is secure and devoid of backdoors and other dangerous code.
KeePassXC is a safe, customisable password manager for various devices and platforms.

* What treaths does it protect against?

KeePassXC protects against numerous password security threats:

Password reuse attacks: Someone reuses a password across many accounts. Hackers can use one password to access other accounts. KeePassXC generates strong passwords for each account and stores them in an encrypted database to prevent password reuse.

Phishing attacks: Hackers pose as reputable websites or services to steal login credentials. KeePassXC automatically fills in the correct credentials for a website when you visit it, protecting you from phishing attacks.

Keylogging attacks: Malware can record anything you input on your computer, even passwords. KeePassXC's virtual keyboard lets you enter passwords securely without using your real keyboard, preventing keylogging attacks.

Brute force attacks: Hackers use automated systems to test every conceivable password. KeePassXC generates complex, hard-to-guess passwords to prevent brute force assaults.

KeePassXC protects accounts against multiple password security concerns. It's crucial to adopt excellent password hygiene and other security best practices because no password manager can defend against all forms of assaults.

* What information is encrypted, what's not?

AES and Twofish algorithms encrypt all password database data in KeePassXC. Also:

Passwords: The master password you set when you build KeePassXC encrypts your passwords.

Usernames and URLs: Each password entry's username and URL are encrypted.

Notes and other metadata: The password entering additionally encrypts notes and tags.

The password database's contents are encrypted, but not the application or your machine. The KeePassXC user interface, configuration settings, and database backups are not encrypted by default.

KeePassXC also briefly stores login credentials in your computer's memory, which is not encrypted. If someone breaks into your computer while you're logged in, they could access this information. After logging out or locking your computer, the data is gone.

KeePassXC secures all password database data by encrypting it. To avoid data breaches and other security issues, you should still secure your computer and use KeePassXC carefully.

* What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?

GNU General Public License 2.0 governs KeePassXC (GPLv2). This open-source software license lets users use, modify, and distribute the software under specific restrictions.

Modifiers and distributors must provide the source code and derivative works under the GPLv2. This keeps the program available to the community and shares any upgrades.

Strong copyleft licenses like the GPLv2 force software distributors to follow their requirements. Permissive licenses only need attribution.

KeePassXC's GPLv2 license emphasizes open-source software and community-driven development. It promotes collaboration and innovation while keeping software open and transparent.

* Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?

Data storage in KeePassXC is user-defined. The software lets users store their password database on their hard drive or in a cloud storage service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.

If the user stores their password database locally, it will be stored on their computer's hard drive in KeePassXC's file format (e.g. .kdbx). Users can store files in their documents folder or on an external hard disk.

The user's password database will be saved on the service provider's servers if they choose cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google, Microsoft). The service provider's policies and local data storage and privacy laws determine the data's location.

Cloud-based password storage services offer simple access from numerous devices and locations, but they also pose security and privacy threats. If the user stores their password database in the cloud, they should pick a trustworthy and secure service provider, implement two-factor authentication, and change their master password regularly. To secure their data, users may opt to encrypt the password database file before transferring it to the cloud.


* How is the data protected?

KeePassXC protects data numerous ways:

Encryption: AES and Twofish algorithms encrypt passwords, usernames, notes, and other metadata in the password database. Encryption prevents anyone from reading the password database file without the master password.

Master password: To access data in the password database, you need the master password. To prevent unwanted access, choose and secure a strong, unique master password.

Two-factor authentication: KeePassXC supports two-factor authentication, which adds a layer of security by requiring a second factor, such as a fingerprint or a mobile app code, in addition to the master password.

Auto-lock: KeePassXC can automatically lock the password database after a specific amount of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access if the user leaves their computer.

Secure clipboard: While copying and pasting passwords from the password database, KeePassXC uses a secure clipboard feature that clears the clipboard after a specific time to prevent other applications or users from accessing the password.

KeePassXC protects password database data with encryption, strong passwords, and other security measures. Nonetheless, users must choose strong passwords, secure their master password, and secure their computer and password database file.

## a) Demonstrate the use of a password manager.

KeePassXC has so many features that I can't show you all of them. I'll show the most important steps: how to install and use KeePassXC and integrate with browsers. 


I am going to intsall on my Macbook Pro M1 2020 8GB MacOS Ventura 13.1.

Is important to install from official website [keepassxc.org](https://keepassxc.org/) 

To install for Mac should be pressed a button install for Mac

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/keepassxcinstall.png" width="800" height="400">

Because I had already installed brew, I had to copy the command "brew install --cask keepassxc" and run it to install it through brew. 

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/brewinstall.png" width="800" height="400">

if you do not have brew installed then you can go to [brew's website](https://brew.sh/) and copy the command and run it in the terminal 

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/homebrew.png" width="800" height="400">

I already installed keepassxc, and below is an example of how it would look if it were installed and you ran the command

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/terminalinstall.png" width="800" height="400">
 
 After installation I ran the keepassxc and pressed to create a database and named it Passwords

 <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/keepass2.png" width="800" height="400">
 
The application then asked for the decryption time, and it is crucial to note that the longer it takes to decrypt, the stronger the encryption is, and it requires more processing power to decrypt. It is also critical to adopt the database format KDBX 4 because it is the most recent and has not been hacked.

 <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/keepass3.png" width="800" height="400">
 
 
The next step is to create a really strong password because it grants access to databases via passwords. This password will be asked to get access to database's content each time of using KeePassXC.
 
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/keepass4.png" width="800" height="400">

Key Files and YubiKeys can also be added for additional security. However, I did not add Key files or YubiKeys

 <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/keepass5.png" width="800" height="400">
 
We have created a database and to add password to the database, click the Plus icon in the toolbar. As depicted by the circle in the image below, KeePassXC also permits users to set expiration dates for their entries and includes a password generator.

 <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/addpass.png" width="800" height="400">
 
I entered my Facebook password and stopped the application to see if it would prompt me for it again when I ran it.

 <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/askspass.png" width="800" height="400">
 
As indicated in the screenshot above, the application will request a password to access the database.

We gain access to the database after inputting the password, as seen below. There are two buttons for copying the login and password to the clipboard. The copied clipboard content will vanish in 10 seconds.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/mypass.png" width="800" height="400">

To integrate browsers with the KeePassXC desktop application, go to **Settings**, choose the **Browser Integration option**, and then select the **Enable browser integration on checkbox**. Activate the integration for the browsers you possess. Next step o click on browser name to install plugin in my case is firefox.
 
 
  <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/keepass7.png" width="800" height="400">
  
 
 It opened to the page where we need to click to install the plugin
 
 
 <img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h5/img/keepass7.png" width="800" height="400">
 
 The next step is to open the website where we want to enter the password and then click on the plugin and connect button. When we connect the plugin, we must have KeePassXC running. With KeePassXC, we must enter a unique id for the connection, and then we will see a keepasxc icon next to the username, which may be clicked to fill out the username and password.

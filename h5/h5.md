## x) Read and summarize Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 (from start until the start of "Dereferencing Keys" in 10.4)

## Section 10 Using Algorithms

Cryptography is a security method that uses math to keep a system safe. Cryptography is the study of secure methods of sending communications that only the sender and the intended recipient can read. The old idea of computer cryptography as "spy against spy" technology is becoming less and less accurate. Almost all of the cryptography used in the world is not meant to protect military secrets. Instead, it is used to make it harder for people to commit small crimes. Most of the apps had bad encryption, but the attacks that worked had nothing to do with cryptanalysis. Most security problems in this area are caused by mistakes in how things are done, not by mistakes in algorithms or protocols. In these cases, it didn't matter how good the encryption was; the attacks that worked completely sidestepped it.


## Section 10.1: CHOOSING AN ALGORITHM
People have a few options when it comes to evaluating and choosing algorithms:

* They can choose a published method since numerous cryptographers have examined it and no one has broken it.
* People trust manufacturers because a well-known company has a reputation to keep and is unlikely to sell equipment or applications with worse algorithms.
* A private consultant can evaluate algorithms impartially, so they can trust them.
* People trust the government because they think it won't mislead them.
* They build their own algorithms because they believe they are the best at cryptography and should trust no one but themselves.

The first option seems greatest, but all have drawbacks. Trusting one corporation, consultancy, or government is risky. Most security consultants don't understand encryption, even if they work for big companies. Most security product makers aren't better. The NSA employs world-class cryptographers who don't reveal all. Their goals differ from those of their population. Even a genius shouldn't build their own algorithm and utilize it without checking it.

The general public doesn't know what military cryptanalysis organizations can do, and it's hard to figure out what algorithms the NSA can break. If the NSA knows how to break an algorithm, they usually don't tell anyone. People think that the NSA can read any message it wants, but it has to choose which ones to read first because it has limited resources. Most people should choose public algorithms that have stood up to scrutiny from the public.

### Algorithms for Export

US export algorithms require government approval. These export-approved algorithms are believed to be NSA-breakable. The NSA is known to discreetly advise cryptography product exporters on several matters:

* Leak ciphertext key bits occasionally.
* Reduce the effective key to 30-bits. The method may accept 100-bit keys, but most are equal.
* Encrypt each encrypted message with a predetermined IV or header. This aids known-plaintext attacks.
* Encrypt a few random bytes with the key and put the plaintext and ciphertext at the beginning of the encrypted message. This aids known-plaintext attacks.

NSA receives the source code, but the algorithm remains secret. Beware if you buy an export-approved U.S. encryption product.

## Section 10.2: PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY VERSUS SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY

The question is whether public-key cryptography or symmetric cryptography is superior. The question is incorrect since we cannot compare these two approaches because each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In some scenarios, one strategy is more useful than another. While symmetric encryption is more cost-effective in terms of message amount and duration, public-key cryptography offers significant security benefits. For key management and a wide range of protocols, public-key cryptography is suitable, whereas symmetric cryptography is ideal for data encryption. Both encryption approaches have advantages and downsides, and they deal with various types of problems.

## Section 10.3: ENCRYPTING COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS

The author says that encryption can happen at any layer in the OSI communications model, but that it usually happens at layers one and two or higher. When encryption happens at the lowest layers, it is called link-by-link encryption, and when it happens at the highest layers, it is called end-to-end encryption. The first one encrypts everything that goes through a certain data link, while the second one encrypts only some of the data and keeps it encrypted until the intended recipient decrypts it. The author talks about the pros and cons of each method.

Link-by-link encryption is the easiest way to add encryption, and it works very well because it encrypts everything and doesn't tell the cryptanalyst anything about how the information is structured. The security doesn't depend on any kind of traffic management, and it's easy to keep track of the keys. But the biggest problem with encryption at the physical layer is that every physical link in the network needs to be encrypted and every node in the network needs to be protected because it processes unencrypted data.

### Advantages:

* Easier operation, since it can be made transparent to the user. That is, everything is encrypted before being sent over the link.
* Only one set of keys per link is required.
* Provides traffic-flow security, since any routing information is encrypted.
* Encryption is online.

### Disadvantages:

* Data is exposed in the intermediate nodes.

On the other hand, end-to-end encryption gets around the problem of encryption and decryption at the physical layer. End-to-end encryption keeps the data encrypted until it gets to its final destination. But the routing information for the data isn't encrypted, and it's harder to keep track of the keys because each user must make sure they have the same ones. It's hard to make equipment that encrypts from end to end, and each type of communication system has its own protocols.

### Advantages:

* Higher secrecy level.

### Disadvantages:

* Requires a more complex key-management system.
* Traffic analysis is possible, since routing information is not encrypted.
* Encryption is offline.

Higher-level encryption works with the user software and can be done by the software or by special hardware. Before sending the data to lower layers, the computer will send it to the special hardware for encryption. In the end, the author says that each approach has its own pros and cons, and that the choice of encryption method will depend on what the communication system needs and wants.

Section 10.4: ENCRYPTING DATA FOR STORAGE

Hash functions are used to generate a fixed-length output from an input of arbitrary length
Examples include the SHA-1 and SHA-2 algorithms
Hash functions are used for message authentication, digital signatures, and password storage

## y) Choose a password manager. 
* Explain: 
* What treaths does it protect against?
* What information is encrypted, what's not?
* What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
* Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
* How is the data protected?

* Pass is a free and open-source password manager that uses GPG encryption to secure the user's data. Here are the answers to your questions about Pass:

* Threats: Pass protects against various threats, such as password reuse, brute force attacks, and phishing, by allowing users to generate unique and complex passwords for each account and store them securely in an encrypted format.

* Encrypted information: Pass encrypts the user's passwords, usernames, and other information using GPG encryption. However, some metadata, such as the name of the website or service associated with each password, may not be encrypted.

* License: Pass is released under the GPLv2 license, which is a free and open-source software license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely. This license ensures that Pass will always remain free and open-source and that any modifications made to the software must be released under the same license.

* Data storage: Pass stores the user's data locally on their device, in a plain text format. This means that the user's data is not stored in the cloud or on a remote server. However, users can choose to sync their password store using a cloud storage service of their choice, such as Dropbox or Google Drive.

* Data protection: Pass uses GPG encryption to secure the user's data both at rest and in transit. Additionally, Pass relies on the user's GPG keypair to provide authentication and access control, which ensures that only the user who owns the GPG keypair can access their password store. It is important to note that because Pass stores data locally on the user's device, it is up to the user to ensure that their device is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

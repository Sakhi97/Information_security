## x) Read and summarize [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003).

## 2.3 One-Way Functions

* **A one-way function is important in public-key cryptography. One-way functions are not protocols themselves, but they are an essential component of the majority of protocols.** One-way functions are simple to calculate but difficult to invert. If you are given x, it is simple to calculate f(x), but is difficult to determine x when given f(x). It might take millions of years to solve even if every computer in the world worked on it at the same time. A typical example of a one-way function is breaking a plate into little pieces, which is simple to do but complex to reconstruct.

**The picture below shows a good example of a one-way function.**

* **The existence of one-way functions has not been confirmed mathematically, and there is no evidence that they can exist.** However, many functions appear to be have one-way functions in their fundamental concept because they can be efficiently calculated and not being reversed. A simple example of such a function is x2, but x1/2 is far more complicated to calculate. If messages encrypted using a one-way function, they cannot be decrypted, and thats why one-way function is not used used for encryption.

* **A trapdoor one-way function is a special type of one-way function with secret trap-door.** With the trapdoor one-way function, it is easy to compute in one direction but difficult in the other, but if you know the secret, it becomes easy to compute in both directions. A watch disassembly is an example of a trapdoor one-way function since it is difficult to rebuild without the instructions but much easier with them.

# H4 Hash

## x) Read and summarize [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003).

## 2.3 One-Way Functions

* **A one-way function is important in public-key cryptography. One-way functions are not protocols themselves, but they are an essential component of the majority of protocols.** One-way functions are simple to calculate but difficult to invert. If you are given x, it is simple to calculate f(x), but is difficult to determine x when given f(x). It might take millions of years to solve even if every computer in the world worked on it at the same time. A typical example of a one-way function is breaking a plate into little pieces, which is simple to do but complex to reconstruct.

**The picture below shows a good example of a one-way function.**

* **The existence of one-way functions has not been confirmed mathematically, and there is no evidence that they can exist.** However, many functions appear to be have one-way functions in their fundamental concept because they can be efficiently calculated and not being reversed. A simple example of such a function is x2, but x1/2 is far more complicated to calculate. If messages encrypted using a one-way function, they cannot be decrypted, and thats why one-way function is not used used for encryption.

* **A trapdoor one-way function is a special type of one-way function with secret trap-door.** With the trapdoor one-way function, it is easy to compute in one direction but difficult in the other, but if you know the secret, it becomes easy to compute in both directions. A watch disassembly is an example of a trapdoor one-way function since it is difficult to rebuild without the instructions but much easier with them.

**The picture below has a simple visualisation of a trapdoor one-way function.**

## 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions

* One-way hash functions are a fundamental part of cryptography and used in many protocols.
* A hash function is a mathematical or other type of function that takes a variable-length input string (pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length (hash value)
* The hash function operates in one direction, making it easy to convert pre-image to hash value but hard to reverse the process.
* A good hash function should not have collisions, meaning it's hard for two different pre-images to have the same hash value.
* The security of the hash function lies in its one-wayness and the fact that a small change in the pre-image results in a significant change in the hash value.
* Changing just one bit of the pre-image can change half of the bits in the hash value
* It's difficult to determine the original pre-image from the hash value.
* Hash functions can be used to verify if someone has a particular file without sending the file itself, useful in financial transactions
* Hash functions are usually used without a key, allowing anyone to verify, but a key can be used to enhance security.

**Pictures below have simple visualisation of a one-way hash functions.**

## a) Install Hashcat.

I followed the instruction on webpage [Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/) and used the command `sudo apt-get update`to to download package information from all configured sources and after I used the command `sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget`to imstall Hashcat.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/installhash.png" width="750" height="350">

I had previously installed hashcat, so in my case, it simply displayed the 0 upgrade.

Next, I created a directory for my work using the commands `mkdir hashed` and `cd hashed`to create and enter the directory.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/mkdir.png" width="750" height="60">

Next, I downloaded the most popular dictionary Rockyou with the commands <br>
`wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz` <br>
`tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz`and <br>
`rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz`

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/rockyou.png" width="750" height="60">

So, now we are ready to crack the hash.

## b) Crack this hash: `8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f`

To crack the hash `8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f`, I first identified the hash using the command `hashid -m 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f`.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/analyze.png" width="750" height="350">

Next, I used the command `hashcat -m 0 '8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f' rockyou.txt -o solved` to start cracking the hash

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/crack1.png" width="750" height="350">

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/crack1.png" width="750" height="350">

I got the status 'Cracked' in the result so it means that hash is cracked.

I used the command `cat solved` to view the contents of the file 'solved', which contains the result of my effort.


<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/result.png" width="750" height="60">

As it is shown in picture above the password is **february**.


## c) Compile John the Ripper, Jumbo version

First I installed libraries requried for John with the command <br>
`sudo apt-get -y install micro bash-completion git build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev zlib-gst libbz2-1.0 libbz2-dev atool zip wget`

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/packages.png" width="750" height="60">

Next, I downloded/cloned John the Ripper, Jumbo version with the command <br>
`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/openwall/john.git`

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/clone.png" width="750" height="250">

Next, I had to use the commands before compilation <br>

`cd john/src/` <br>
`./configure` <br>

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/configure.png" width="750" height="70">

Next, with the command `make -s clean && make -sj4` we start compiling

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/makeclean.png" width="750" height="150">

So, John the Reaper has been downloaded and to run the programm I used the command `$HOME/john/run/john`

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/home.png" width="750" height="150">

The program is operating successfully.

## d) Crack a zip file password

First I had to download the zip file with password and I used the command `wget https://TeroKarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/tero.zip`


<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/getfile.png" width="750" height="220">

When the file was downloaded, I attempted to unzip it using the command `unzip tero.zip`  but I was prompted for a password, so I tried leaving it blank; even so, I was informed that the password was incorrect. I also attempted to enter a random password, which was similarly incorrect.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/unzip.png" width="750" height="170">

To crack the password I used the command `$HOME/john/run/zip2john tero.zip >tero.zip.hash`to exctract the hash into new file 

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/homerun.png" width="750" height="170">

Next, I used the command `$HOME/john/run/john tero.zip.hash` which let John to perform the attack against the hash.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/homerunjohn.png" width="750" height="170">

In thr result I got a lot of output but there is one line which contains the password

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/butterfly.png" width="750" height="50">

So the password is **butterfly**. I used againg the command `unzip tero.zip` and used **butterfly** for the password.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/found.png" width="750" height="180">

The zip file succesfully was unzipped.

## n) Voluntary: create a password protected file other than ZIP. Crack the password.

I have macbook 2020 M1 chip 8 GB macOS Ventura 13.1.

First, I made a folder called sakhizip, and then I made a txt file called mytext.txt in that folder with a password. After I launched Terminal and navigated to the location of my folder. Then I used the `zip -er sakhiZip.zip sakhizip`command to zip my folder and created a password for it.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/makezip.png" width="600" height="180">

Next, I downloaded my zip file in my debian virtual machine and tried to unzip.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/tryunzip.png" width="600" height="180">

Next, I used the command `$HOME/john/run/zip2john sakhiZip.zip >sakhi.zip.hash`to exctract the hash into new file.
Next; I used the command `$HOME/john/run/john sakhi.zip.hash` which let John to perform the attack against the hash.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/runonzip.png" width="600" height="180">

John the Reaper succecully cracked the password which is **11223349**

Next, I used the password to unzip and see the content of mytext.txt

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h4/succes.png" width="600" height="230">

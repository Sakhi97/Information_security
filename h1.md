### x) A summary of the Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action

* APT hackers steal data for military or economic gain. Industry and the US government have identified APTs. APTs cannot be mitigated by conventional incident response. Krekel (2009) details a sophisticated intrusion. The death chain analysis demonstrates that the enemy must fulfill each stage to succeed. Defenders can utilize this paradigm to create durable defenses and strategically prioritize new technology and processes.

* Phase-based models model APTs and countermeasures. The US Department of Defense defines a kill chain as find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess. The US Air Force uses this strategy to identify ISR capacity gaps. Attack-Based Sequential Analysis of Countermeasures (ABSAC) aligns countermeasure types throughout the attack's temporal period.

* CND manages threat risk. One mitigation breaks the kill chain and defeats the enemy. Defenders must exploit any opponent repeat. Defenders who implement countermeasures faster than adversaries increase the cost of achieving goals.

* The strategy bases intelligence on the indicator. Indications are objective descriptions of intrusions. atomic, computational, and behavioral indicators. Incident data-derived computed indicators. Calculated and atomic behavioral indicators are often qualified by amount and combinatorial logic.

* Kill chains engage opponents to obtain results. Find enemy targets suitable for engagement; locate; monitor and observe; target with appropriate weapon or asset to achieve desired results; fight; effects (2007)

Intrusion kill chain components:

1. reconnaissance: discover
2. weaponization: combining a delivery, exploit, and payload.
3. Weapon distribution via email attachments, websites, and USBs
4. Exploiting the intruder's code
5. Installing remote access or a backdoor to persist
6. C2: beacon for "hands on the keyboard"
7. fulfilling host objectives like data collecting

* An enterprise's defensive capabilities can be matched to an attacker's steps using the intrusion kill chain intelligence model. Analysts improve defenses after each attack. The defense makes successful invasions more expensive for the attacker. The defenders discover an unfixable zero-day exploit in December. In March, the opponent reuses the exploit but alters its weaponization and delivery.

* Kill chain analysis identifies defensive information. Most invasions report one phase. Preventing future intrusions requires evaluating past phases. Network defenders establish resilience against adversaries' intrusion persistence. Intruders save money by reusing equipment. Data-gathering defenders will spot assailants earlier in the kill chain.

### A summary of Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

Beginner's guide to Linux commands. I utilized all of the commands in my previous course, so I just went through some of them again.

List files in working directory `$ ls`

Prints working directory `$ pwd`
   
Moves up or down in dir `$ cd ..`
    
Shows manual page for ls `$ man ls`
    
Creates a file txt in nano editor `$ nano FOO.TXT`
    
 Etc.
 
### a) Bandit oh-five. Solve Over The Wire: Bandit the first five levels (0-4).

To solve the first task, I used the command
`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
and used the command 
`ls`
to list files in the directory. 
I used the 
`cat readme command` to see the content of readme file. I found the password, which I copied and used for the next task.

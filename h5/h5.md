## x) Read and summarize Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 (from start until the start of "Dereferencing Keys" in 10.4)

## Section 10 Using Algorithms

Cryptography is a security method that uses math to keep a system safe. Cryptography is the study of secure methods of sending communications that only the sender and the intended recipient can read. The old idea of computer cryptography as "spy against spy" technology is becoming less and less accurate. Almost all of the cryptography used in the world is not meant to protect military secrets. Instead, it is used to make it harder for people to commit small crimes. Most of the apps had bad encryption, but the attacks that worked had nothing to do with cryptanalysis. Most security problems in this area are caused by mistakes in how things are done, not by mistakes in algorithms or protocols. In these cases, it didn't matter how good the encryption was; the attacks that worked completely sidestepped it.


## Section 10.1: Introduction to Algorithms
People have a few options when it comes to evaluating and choosing algorithms:

* They can choose a published method since numerous cryptographers have examined it and no one has broken it.
* People trust manufacturers because a well-known company has a reputation to keep and is unlikely to sell equipment or applications with worse algorithms.
* A private consultant can evaluate algorithms impartially, so they can trust them.
* People trust the government because they think it won't mislead them.
* They build their own algorithms because they believe they are the best at cryptography and should trust no one but themselves.

The first option seems greatest, but all have drawbacks. Trusting one corporation, consultancy, or government is risky. Most security consultants don't understand encryption, even if they work for big companies. Most security product makers aren't better. The NSA employs world-class cryptographers who don't reveal all. Their goals differ from those of their population. Even a genius shouldn't build their own algorithm and utilize it without checking it.

The general public doesn't know what military cryptanalysis organizations can do, and it's hard to figure out what algorithms the NSA can break. If the NSA knows how to break an algorithm, they usually don't tell anyone. People think that the NSA can read any message it wants, but it has to choose which ones to read first because it has limited resources. Most people should choose public algorithms that have stood up to scrutiny from the public.

### Algorithms for Export

US export algorithms require government approval. These export-approved algorithms are believed to be NSA-breakable. The NSA is known to discreetly advise cryptography product exporters on several matters:

* Leak ciphertext key bits occasionally.
* Reduce the effective key to 30-bits. The method may accept 100-bit keys, but most are equal.
* Encrypt each encrypted message with a predetermined IV or header. This aids known-plaintext attacks.
* Encrypt a few random bytes with the key and put the plaintext and ciphertext at the beginning of the encrypted message. This aids known-plaintext attacks.

NSA receives the source code, but the algorithm remains secret. Beware if you buy an export-approved U.S. encryption product.

## Section 10.2: Symmetric-Key Algorithms

Symmetric-key algorithms use the same key for encryption and decryption
Examples include the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and Blowfish
The strength of a symmetric-key algorithm is dependent on the key size and the number of rounds used in the algorithm

## Section 10.3: Asymmetric-Key Algorithms

Asymmetric-key algorithms use a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption
Examples include the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms
Asymmetric-key algorithms are slower than symmetric-key algorithms but are useful for key exchange and digital signatures

Section 10.4: Hash Functions

Hash functions are used to generate a fixed-length output from an input of arbitrary length
Examples include the SHA-1 and SHA-2 algorithms
Hash functions are used for message authentication, digital signatures, and password storage

## y) Choose a password manager. 
* Explain: 
* What treaths does it protect against?
* What information is encrypted, what's not?
* What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
* Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
* How is the data protected?

* Pass is a free and open-source password manager that uses GPG encryption to secure the user's data. Here are the answers to your questions about Pass:

* Threats: Pass protects against various threats, such as password reuse, brute force attacks, and phishing, by allowing users to generate unique and complex passwords for each account and store them securely in an encrypted format.

* Encrypted information: Pass encrypts the user's passwords, usernames, and other information using GPG encryption. However, some metadata, such as the name of the website or service associated with each password, may not be encrypted.

* License: Pass is released under the GPLv2 license, which is a free and open-source software license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely. This license ensures that Pass will always remain free and open-source and that any modifications made to the software must be released under the same license.

* Data storage: Pass stores the user's data locally on their device, in a plain text format. This means that the user's data is not stored in the cloud or on a remote server. However, users can choose to sync their password store using a cloud storage service of their choice, such as Dropbox or Google Drive.

* Data protection: Pass uses GPG encryption to secure the user's data both at rest and in transit. Additionally, Pass relies on the user's GPG keypair to provide authentication and access control, which ensures that only the user who owns the GPG keypair can access their password store. It is important to note that because Pass stores data locally on the user's device, it is up to the user to ensure that their device is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

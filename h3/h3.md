## x) Read and summarize [Costa-Gazcón 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-threat-intelligence/9781838556372/B13376_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-75)

-- "Mapping the Adversary" is a strategy that involves collecting information about possible attackers, their methods, and their goals so that you can defend yourself better against them. It is seen as a good thing because it gives a more complete picture of the threat landscape, which can help make better security and response plans. If an organization knows who its enemy is, it can focus its defenses on the most likely ways it will be attacked and be better ready to respond quickly and effectively if it is attacked.

Important ponts to know for better mapping the adversary :

* Knowing your opponent's motivations, strategies, and techniques is critical.
* Understanding the architecture, tactics, and tools of the opposition
* How to assess the sophistication and capacity of the adversary
* Adversary intelligence gathering:
* Enemy intelligence sources, including open-source, commercial, and internal sources
* The significance of obtaining knowledge from multiple sources
* Threat intelligence platforms' roles in gathering and managing enemy intelligence
<br>
* Analyzing adversarial behavior:
The significance of recognizing trends in enemy conduct
How to apply adversary behavior analysis to comprehend their strategies, tactics, approaches, and procedures (TTPs)
Machine learning's role in automating adversary behavior analysis
Analysis of adversary infrastructure:
<br>
Understanding the adversary's infrastructure, including command and control servers and other resources, is critical.
How to locate and map your adversary's infrastructure
The significance of network analysis in comprehending the adversary's architecture
Adversary identification:
<br>
The difficulties in attribution of cyber attacks to specific enemies
The significance of employing a variety of procedures and sources to validate attribution
The use of digital forensics and malware analysis in attributing individual adversaries to attacks
The life cycle of the adversary:

* Understanding the many stages of an adversary's life cycle, such as target selection, intrusion, and post-infiltration activities
It is critical to map the adversary's life cycle in order to detect potential vulnerabilities and inform response and mitigation techniques.

* My Thought: In threat intelligence and data-driven threat hunting, mapping the opponent is critical. It assists organizations in understanding their attackers' goals, methods, and techniques, as well as their infrastructure, behavior, and attribution. Understanding the adversary's life cycle can help inform response and mitigation methods, making the organization more resilient to cyber threats.

## Write an answer with references. Answer in the context of [Mitre Att&ck](https://attack.mitre.org/), and pick examples that are different from the chapter in task x

* Mitre Att&ck is a knowledge repository of adversary tactics and techniques used in cyber attacks that is available globally. The framework provides a common language and knowledge of adversary tactics, methods, and procedures (TTPs), which businesses can utilize to improve their threat intelligence and security posture.
* Credential Access: stealing account names and passwords
- Technique: "Brute Forcing"- This technique may be fairly simple if the attacker does not trigger account lockdown and employs password guessing because many users still use weak passwords.

<br>
* A tactic explains the overarching purpose of the attack and describes what the enemy wants to accomplish. The approach "Initial Access," for example, outlines how an adversary gains a foothold in a target's network.
<br>
* In Mitre Att&ck, a technique is a specialized strategy utilized by an enemy to attain a tactical aim. A technique is a more specific description of an adversary's actions. The technique "Exploit Public-Facing Application," for example, describes using a vulnerability in a web application to get initial access to a target's network.
<br>
* Subtechnique: In Mitre Att&ck, a subtechnique is a sub-component of a technique that provides even more detail on the exact actions made by an adversary. For example, the subtechnique "SQL Injection" outlines a specific approach of employing SQL injection to exploit a vulnerability in a web application.
<br>
* In Mitre Att&ck, a method is a step-by-step explanation of an adversary's actions during an assault. Procedures explain an adversary's specific activities taken to acquire a technique or subtechnique. For example, the operation "Gain Valid Credentials" details the steps an adversary takes to obtain valid credentials for a target's network, which might be a strategy used to achieve the tactical aim of "Initial Access".

* My opinion: Mitre Att&ck gives an organized and thorough understanding of adversaries' TTPs in cyber attacks. By offering a consistent vocabulary and understanding of adversary tactics, strategies, and procedures, the framework assists businesses in improving their threat intelligence and security posture.

## Webgoat: A3 Sensitive data exposure Insecure Login: 2 Let's try
In Webgoat, I successfully completed the "Insecure Login: 2 Let's Try" lesson. This lesson educated me about the dangers of exposing sensitive data during the login process and how to avoid them.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h3/webgoat3.png" width="650" height="450">

Using the instructions in the assignment, I decided to utilize a sniffing tool (Packet Sniffing is the process of expanding monitors checks every packet that passes through any network). I looked up which tool is to monitor pakets which are passed thouw network and in the result decided to instal Wireshark because is one of the most popular one and I found intruction [how to install Wireshark](https://linuxhint.com/install-wireshark-debian-11/).
To install wireshark I used the command `su` to get acces as sudoer and after I used the command `sudo apt install wireshark -y`

After installation I opened wireshark and chose 'loopback: lo' and pressed on shark fin

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h3/wloopback.png" width="650" height="250">

Then I tried to log in with my credential. NOTE! Has to be pressed button **"Log In"** not **"Submit"**

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h3/login.png" width="850" height="250">

In wireshark I stopped tracking packets I used `http.request.method=="POST"`to filter all packets and find all post packets. Then I pressed on POST method mvc packet where I got username and password.

Also I tried another methof which also works without installing wireshark. I right clicked on the login page and chose inspect. After I switched from **Inspector tab** to **Network tab** and tried to login. Then I chose request tab and I got post request and clicked on it where I found username and password.

## m) Voluntary difficult bonus: WebGoat: SQL Injection (advanced)

In Webgoat, I successfully completed the "SQL Injection Advanced" class. This class educated me about SQL injection attacks and how to avoid them.

Logging in to Webgoat using the provided username and password was the first step in finishing the class. I then went to the "SQL Injection Advanced" tutorial. I examined the application to see if it was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. I noticed that the application was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks and that I could insert malicious SQL code into the input fields to gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.

### task 3

6.a) Retrieve all data from the table

To retrieve all data from table I used the command line `'; SELECT * FROM user_system_data;--` also I could use

6.b) When you have figured it out…​. What is Dave’s password?

Password: `passW0rD`

### task 5

Goal: Can you login as Tom?

The Login form appears to provide no helpful outputs from a range of inputs, whereas the Register form allows us to check whether a username already exists.
I tried to sign up using the following username: 'tom' AND '1'='1 is already in use.
I started using tom username to check Tom's password one by one.
Fortunately, the table I was looking for is called password, so I tried to register using the username: substring(password,1,1)='t' AND tom'
The response indicated that the username already exists, so I know that the first character of Tom's password is t.
I determined Tom's password by trying for the remaining characters.

<img src="https://github.com/Sakhi97/Information_security/blob/main/h3/sqldone.png" width="650" height="450">

I learned how dangerous can be SQL injection attacks and made some points what can help to resist SQL injection:

* Instead of concatenating user-supplied input into SQL statements, utilize parameterized queries.
* Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it is free of dangerous code.
* To identify and prevent SQL injection attacks, use proper security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
* Monitor logs on a regular basis for any strange activity or unwanted access attempts.
* My opinion: by finishing the "SQL Injection Advanced" lesson in Webgoat, I obtained a greater grasp of the dangers of SQL injection attacks and how to prevent them. This class is recommended for anyone interested in learning about web application security and the need of safeguarding sensitive data stored in databases.
